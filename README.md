# ResumeAPI w/ Azure Functions
Resume API challenge with Azure Functions

## Introduction 📑
I've been inspired by the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forest Brazeal to build more stuff in the cloud. I wanted to build something simple to continue my Cloud journey. I decided to build an open-source REST API for my JSON-based standard format resume. I'm using JavaScript and Azure Functions.

## Technologies ⚙
- JavaScirpt
- Azure Functions

## Let's get going 🚀
As part of the #ServerlessSeptember, I submited my project as an article for the event and you can reference to my article here in order to get started with the Resume API.
